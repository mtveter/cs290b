<h3>Design Document</h3>

<h4>1.) API changes:</h4>
<p> 
	We have added a method 'getN()' to the 'Task' interface to get the n-value of each task. For Fibonacci that is the N'th fibonacci number, and for TSP that is the number of cities in the subpartial list of cities.
</p>

<h4>2.) Ameliorate communication latency:</h4>
<p> 
	In an attempt to reduce communication latency the group has implementing the following: </br>
	- Task prefetching:</br>
	Instead of having the 'Computer' just receiving an amount of tasks equal to the number of the 'Computer' cores(or one without multiple worker threads),
	the 'Computer' received if available a double amount 'Task' objects. This will reduced the total number of connections established to finish a 'Job' and hence reduce total communication latency</br>
	</br>
	- Space runnable tasks: </br>
	In some cases it will be beneficial to compute certain 'Task' objects locally in the 'Space' instead of delegating the computation to a 'Computer'. 
	The group has implemented a feature where for a Fibonacci 'Task' the 'Space' will compute 'Task' if the value 'n' is equal to 0 or 1(i.e. base cases of fibonacci recursion). 
	For a TSP 'Task' the 'Space' will delegate a 'Task' to a 'Computer' only if it's a base case. Since base cases of TSP require heavy computing it will be worth the latency to delegate the computation to a 'Computer', 
	while for other cases the 'Space' will compute the 'Task' that only require low amount of computation.
</p>

<h4>3.) Multiple worker threads</h4>
<p> 
	Each 'Computer' will have a given amount of processor cores to assign computation to. By mapping each 'Task' to a distinct processor core parallell execution of 'Task' computation. 
	When a 'Computer' is created, it will create one thread for each available core, and the cores will synchronously take available 'Task' objects from a queue in the 'Computer', 
	execute them and put 'Result' in queue at 'Computer' which will pass 'Result' to 'Space'.
