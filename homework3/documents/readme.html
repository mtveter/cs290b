<i> Instructions to compile and run divide and conquer fibonacci and tsp </i><br><br>
<a href=http://ant.apache.org/> Ant</a> is used to both run and compile the application.<br>

<p><b> 1. Compiling: </b>
<br>Run the command <b>ant</b> to compile program
<br>The application has five packages: 
<br> - api 
<br> - clients 
<br> - system
<br> - tasks
<br> - util

<b><p> 2. Running the code: </b>
<p>Space/server:
<br>2.1 Start the space server by running the command <b>ant runSpace</b>
<p>Computer(s):
<br>2.2 Start computer server(s) by running the command <b>ant runComputer -Darg0="[ip of server machine]"</b>
<p> Clients:
<br>2.3 Fibonacci: To run the Fibonacci task: <b>ant runFibonacciClient -Darg0="[ip of server machine]"</b>
<br>2.4 Euclidean TSP: To run the Euclidean TSP task: <b>ant runTspClient -Darg0="[ip of server machine]"</b>

<p>If no argument is passed with ant command to Clients for FibonacciClient, EuclideanTSP or Computer, the program will use default value for server domain which is "localhost"</p>
